`cephlet` is a Ceph based provider implementation of the [onmetal-api](https://github.com/onmetal/onmetal-api) `Volume` 
and `VolumePool` types.

## Description

> As Ceph does not support the creation of access secrets for each individual block devices, we chose to use Kubernetes `Namespace`s
as a tenant separation. All `Volumes` within a `Namespace` belong essentially to one tenant. 

The task of the `cephlet` is to create a Ceph block device for every `Volume` in a given namespace. Additionally,
for every `Namespace` an own `CephClient` and a corresponding `StorageClass` is created. The `StorageClass` is being used
to later create the `PersistantVolumeClaims` for a given `Namespace`. The access credentials which are being extracted
from the `CephClient` are stored in a `Secret` which is then referenced in the status of the `Volume`.

The graph blow illustrates the relationships between the entities created in the reconciliation flow of a `Volume`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    NS -- one per namespace --> SC[StorageClass]
    NS[Namespace] -- contains --> V
    V[Volume] -- creates  --> PVC[PersistantVolumeClaim]
    NS -- one per namespace --> CC[CephClient]
    CC -- creates --> S[Access Secret]
    V -- references --> S
```

The `VolumePool` is indicating the consumer of the storage API where a `Volume` can be created. The `cephlet` is announcing
its pool as configured and accumulates all supported `VolumeClasses` in the pool status. The mapping between a `VolumePool`
and Ceph is done via the creation of a `CephBlockPool`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    VP[VolumePool] -- creates --> CephBlockPool
    VP -- announce in status --> VC[VolumeClass]
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cephlet:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cephlet:tag
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out

Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
