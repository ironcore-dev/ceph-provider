## Document Terminology

- volume encryption: encryption of a volume attached by rbd
- LUKS: Linux Unified Key Setup: stores all the needed setup information for dm-crypt on the disk
- dm-crypt: linux kernel device-mapper crypto target
- cryptsetup: the command line tool to interface with dm-crypt

## Summary
The primary purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data stored on a device. Encryption removes the risk of data breach and unauthorized access. The proposal for storage encryption would outline the specific encryption method, key management, and other details that would be used to secure the data being stored. This can include policies and procedures for securing the encryption keys, as well as details on how the encryption will be implemented and managed. Overall, the goal of the proposal is to ensure that the data stored is protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. This proposal focuses on providing option to enable encryption for individual Volumes.


## Motivation
- Security: Security is an important concern and should be a strong focus of any Cloud Native IaaS. To protect the data against variety of security threats, including        data breaches, hacking and physical theft, encryption plays vital role.
- Privacy: Encryption helps to maintain privacy of data from being accessed by unauthorised parties.
- Compliance and business cotinuity: In order to meet compliance requirements of businesses keeping the standards and regulations in mind, it becomes essential to          store the encryption enabled data in the cloud so that in the events of disaster and data theft, organizations can recover the data quickly.

Overall, the motivation for a storage encryption proposal is to provide a holostic and secure approach to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulations and standards.


### Goals
- User should be able to create encrypted volumes (https://github.com/onmetal/onmetal-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/06-storage-encryption.md)
- Encrypt block device (RBD image) that CEPH exposes. 


### Non-Goals
- OSD level encryption
- Object storage encryption

## Proposal

### Way 1:
### Details
This way emphasizes more on one level down to abstraction.

- To perform RBD encryption directly at ceph level is by using the LUKS encryption technology, which is built into the Linux kernel and can be used to encrypt block       devices such as RBD. 

- The new RBD image can be created with RBD command line tool or directly from ceph dashboard. LUKS container on the RBD image can be created using `cryptsetup` tool       which can be further mapped to a block device on the client system.

- To use the LUKS format, start by formatting the image:

   ` $ rbd encryption format {pool-name}/{image-name} {luks1|luks2} {passphrase-file} [â€“cipher-alg {aes-128 | aes-256}] `
 
- A file system is created on the mapped block device and is mounted as per the requirement. Mounted file system is the point of contact to write or read the data from     encrypted RBD image.

- To mount a LUKS-encrypted image run:

   ` $ rbd -p {pool-name} device map -t nbd -o encryption-format={luks1|luks2},encryption-passphrase-file={passphrase-file} `

- When writing data to the encrypted RBD image, it is automatically encrypted by LUKS before being written to the RBD image. When reading data from the RBD image, it       is decrypted by LUKS on the client system before being made available to the application.

### Way 2:
### Details
 As of now two types of encryption is supported by Ceph: 
- OSD Level and Block device Level
(Currently we are moving ahead in this proposal with Block device level.)

- Data encryption key(DEK) will be provided by user in volume object. Cephlet will internally create a Key encryption key(KEK), encrypt the data encryption key and add     into the metadata. All the changes will take place in cephCSI.

- Currently when `volume` is created corresponding `PVC` is also created with reference to `storageclass`.
    However, With `Encryption` enabled `Volume` there will be a new storageclass named `encrypted-ceph` will be created which will be referenced while 
    creating encrypted PVCs with cephlet generated passphrase. 
 
- Encrypted storage class will be created with additional parameters as below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-csi-kms-config
  namespace: rook-ceph
data:
  config.json: |-
    {
      "user-secret-metadata": {
        "encryptionKMSType": "metadata",
        "secretName": "storage-encryption-secret"
      }
    }
```

Additionally Update the rook-ceph-operator-config configmap and patch the following configurations
```
kubectl patch cm rook-ceph-operator-config -nrook-ceph -p $'data:\n "CSI_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION": "true"'
```


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: storage-encryption-secret
  namespace: rook-ceph
stringData:
  encryptionPassphrase: test-encryption
```

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-block-encrypted
parameters:
  # additional parameters required for encryption
  encrypted: "true"
  encryptionKMSID: "user-secret-metadata"
# ...
```

The `rook-ceph-block-encrypted` is the encrypted `storage class`.

- The ownership of managing `user-secret-metadata` will be taken by the cephlet.
